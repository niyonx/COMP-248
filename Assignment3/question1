/* This program will stimulate teams playing against each other for a maximum number of 20 tournaments. 
*  We have an array teams16 that stores the teams names. E.g teams16[0] = "Uruguay"
*  We will have an array score of size 16 that will keep the recent scores how many goals each team scored. E.g scores[0] = 4 means that Uruguay scored 4 goals in the recent match
*  We have another array winning that will keep the index of the teams which won. E.g winning[1]= 3 means that teams16[3] (Argentina) won in the second match. winning[11] = 6 means that teams16[6] (Belgium) won in the 12th match.
*  From this, we are able to have a hierarchy of the tournament advancement. (Who will proceed to the next round)
